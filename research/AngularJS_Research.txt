Angular JS
=================

I wanted to try and find some JavaScript libraries that would allow us to create a clean,
easy to read, and consistent user interface. In doing so I landed upon Angular JS.

There are several different libraries that branch off from Angular as a whole, but my focus is:
Angular Material.

Unfortunately, the big factor is that Angular Material is not a free service. They do provide
free trials, but obviously that won't last very long if you're using this for a business, but
it could potentially be worth the cost, but the cost isn't really shown until you are fully commited
to using Angular Material. Another downside that man members of the community have stated is that
Angular Material is very large and can cause problems on start up and when actually trying to run
your code.

However, Angular Material offers several different components that would be beneficial to our design.
In these components the ones that prove to be most beneficial to us are as follows:
Autocomplete, Button, Checkbox, Input, Select, and Grid list.
Now obviously we have all of these implemented currently in our code, but it makes it easier when
translating this to an app version. It seems like the community has also had a big uproar for the
drag and drop features, so it's very easy to just translate where we'd like our information to be
stored and not have to waste time trying to code it in the perfect spot.
