After looking into how to work with SoapUI, John released a video to help the team
setup SoapUI on our devices. It took a bit of time, but I was able to get it set up 
with a few trial and errors. I'll be looking into more of SoapUI's capabilities and 
functionalityas time progresses, but for right now setting this up was a good spot.

I know that SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and it relies heavily on XML.

I found that SoapUI is simple so it allows both technical and non-technical useres to use this seamlessly
It allows for functional, regression, compliance, and load testing.
SoapUI also allows for us to test performance and security.
When our program submits an alert it writes out the XML code that is required by FEMA.
After our program writes out the XML code we can simply plug it into the required spot in SoapUI and test our message to the server.
John was already quite ahead of the group so he has been actively working hard on getting the security to work.
Currently the security is what is giving us the hardest time.

Update: Still can't get the security to work. But talks of switching to Java are happening so ending this here to look into other options.
